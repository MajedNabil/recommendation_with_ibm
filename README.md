This repo is dedicated for the Udacity project called "Recommendations with IBM", on which we inspect a dataset related to articles. The goal is to implement varius 
methods of recommendation techniques discussed during the lessons. This README goes as follows: 
- Installation 
- Important Notes 
## Installation 
I provided the jupyter notebook itself, which can be downlaoded from my repo, then it can be ran as any notebook. Also, I provided a `.html` form of the solution. 
## Important Note
Regarding dictionary-based questions, I solved all of them and made sure they're correct. However, regarding the 1st dictionary (i.e., `sol_1_dict`), I kept getting weird error :(, even though I supplied the right answers. So please take this into consideration.
